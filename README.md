# Git2Sqlite

For this project I wanted to hit a few birds with one stone:

1. Write something in Go, to learn the language.
2. Get an even deeper understanding of how Git internally works.
3. Produce something that might actually be useful.

Enter git2sqlite.

Git2Sqlite takes a target Git repository, reads up the object
database, and turns it into an sqlite database for future 
interrogation.
